Task 0: Basics of HTTP/HTTPS

1. A brief summary explaining the differences between HTTP and HTTPS.
HTTP sends data in requests and responses between client and server in plain text.
HTTPS adds TLS/SSL encryption, to ensure data is confidential and to maintain the data's integrity.
HTTPS is the preferred protocol for transmitting sensitive data (for example, generally financial institutions and email providers would use HTTPS over HTTP)

2. A depiction or outline of the structure of an HTTP request and response.
HTTP Request
A typical HTTP request contains:
a. HTTP version type
b. a URL
c. an HTTP method
d. HTTP request headers
e. Optional HTTP body.

HTTP Response
A typical HTTP response contains:
a. an HTTP status code
b. HTTP response headers
c. optional HTTP body
